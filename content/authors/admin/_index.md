Wimbledon Champion and two time NBA MVP; two accolades 10 year old me would love to have had written in this summary. However, due to unforeseen circumstances (severe lack of ability), I can now write about other exciting successes.

Currently, I work as a technical pre-sales manager for Ravelin. Specialising in technology Risk and Fraud I help companies detect fraudulent behaviour using machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI). Specifically, I ensure that customers trust the tool conducting POC's, responding to RFP's and assisting with integrations.

I have spent two years coding, helping to create CA Agile Requirements Designer, as part of an agile scrum team mostly using C++ but delving into other languages such as C#, JavaScript and SQL. Although I really enjoyed my time in engineering, I jumped at the chance to move into pre-sales as the job offers the benefit of being technical but also visiting customers, allowing me to travel the globe with my work.
